#this is mostly used when altering users input in sites to fit a certain format
#A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data.
#  The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name.
#  Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work.
#  That information is provided inside the parentheses.
#  The title() function doesnâ€™t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.

#using variables within a string(makes it simpler to enter data)
#f string type shii(f-format) enables use of variables within a string

#they reduce the lines of code to be written

#sometimes you have to eliminate whitespace in inputed data for the sake of comparison

#to the computer "python" , "python " and "  python" is different 
# to permanently eliminate whitespace,you have to overwrite the original value
